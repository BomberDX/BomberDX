Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And Ild like to take a minute
Just sit right there
Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, I might as well kick it.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear theyre prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I dont think so
Ill see when I get there
I hope theyre prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I aint trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought Nah, forget it - Yo, home to Bel-Air

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie Yo home smell ya later
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air");
